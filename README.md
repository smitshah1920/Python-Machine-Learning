# Linear Regression Project 2 : App or Website Development Project

contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
