## Linear Regression Project 1: 

I had tried buid predicting model for housing prices for regions in the USA using Linear Regression, allowing one to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

## Linear Regression Project 2 : App or Website Development Project

contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

## Logistic Regression- Advertisement Project

I have worked with a fake advertising data set,indicating whether or not a particular internet user will click on an advertisement based on the features of that user.

## Recommender System(Content based Filtering)  

I have tried to build a recommendation model to recommand similar movies to the viewer by merging two dataframes 'userdata' and 'moviedata' based on correlation and number of movie ratings

## Decision Tree and Random Forest_LandingClub:

Lending Club connects borrowers with investors. As an investor we want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. I will try to create a model that will help predict this. I will use lending Club data from 2007-2010 before they went public and try to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
